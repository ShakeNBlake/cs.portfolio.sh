<h1>Who created this website? </h1>
<p>
    <p>Hi! My name is Blake! I am a 10th grader at Summit Shasta. I am usually not an outdoors person but I have traveled to different places such as: 
Can Cun, Mexico, Hawaii, and many other places.I like to play games and I love learning about technology. I am really good at fixing most problems about technology in my 
My favorite game right now is Counter Strike- Global Offensive, and my favorite movie as of now is Pacific Rim. Counter-Strike is my favorite game because its a fun strategy 
game. Pacific Rim is my favorite movie because it is like a mix of transformers and godzilla. I started to play CSGO because I watched many people play the game and it seemed
really fun to play. I loved Pacific Rim because it was a movie that looked really awesome, then I watched the trailer, and I started to like the movie more and more.
