<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Blake! I am a 10th grader at Summit Shasta. I am usually not an outdoors person but I have traveled to different places such as: 
Can Cun, Mexico, Hawaii, and many other places.I love to play games and i wanted to know how to make them. So i tried coding and i took this class as my Expeditions P.M. class.</p>
